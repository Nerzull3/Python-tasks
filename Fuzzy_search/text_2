No news good news.
No pains, no gains.
No song, no supper.
Nothing new under sun.
No wisdom like silence.
Of two evils choose the list.
One fire drives out another.
One man may steal a horse while another may not look over a hedge.
One man’s meat is another man’s poison.
One swallow does not make a summer.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Patience is a plaster for all sores.
Rome was not built in a day.
Salt water and absence wash away love.
Saying and doing are two things.
Score twice before you cut once.
Still waters have deep bottoms.
The cowl does not make the monk.
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
The devil is not so black as he is painted.
The devil lurks behind the cross.
The devil sometimes speaks the truth.
The early bird catches the worm.
The game is not worth the candle.
The heart that once truly loves never forgets.
